# chess-program
This is a prototype for a chess program I finished senior year of high school in Spring 2022 using java in eclipse. There are two game modes. One is a fully functional two player game mode. The second is one player versus a primitive chess bot. The bot can only play random moves. All chess rules and promotions are implemented.

To run the chess program, first download the "ChessProgramFinalZip.zip" file attached to this repository. Open eclipse and select "Import". Select "Existing Projects in Workspace". Select "archive file:" and select "ChessProgramFinalZip.zip" from your downloads. Click finish and this should add a java project called "Chess" to your package explorer. Open the project and find "ChessGame.java" from the "src" folder. Run "ChessGame.java".
