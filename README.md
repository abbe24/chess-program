# chess-program
This is a prototype for a chess program I finished senior year of high school in Spring 2022 using java in eclipse. There are two game modes. One is a fully functional two player game mode. The second is one player versus a primitive chess bot. The bot can only play random moves. All chess rules and promotions are implemented.
