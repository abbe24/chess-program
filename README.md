# chess-program
This is a prototype for a chess program I finished senior year of high school in Spring 2022 using java in eclipse. I wrote the project from the ground up unassisted from AI and worked on it for about four months. There are two game modes. One is a fully functional two player game mode. The second is one player versus a primitive chess bot. The bot can only play random moves. A large tree datastructure is implemented to store possible future board combinations. All chess rules and promotions are implemented such as castling, en passant, and promotion. The project totals about 2,000 lines.

To run the chess program, first download the "ChessProgramFinalZip.zip" file attached to this repository. Open eclipse and select "Import". Select "Existing Projects in Workspace". Select "archive file:" and select "ChessProgramFinalZip.zip" from your downloads. Click finish and this should add a java project called "Chess" to your package explorer. Open the project and find "ChessGame.java" from the "src" folder. Run "ChessGame.java". If that doesn't work, just extract the zip file to your project folder and run ChessGame.java.
